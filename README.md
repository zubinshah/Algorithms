# Algorithms
Data structures, algorithms, and solutions to programming exercises.

This repository contains implementation and programming solutions to common data
structures, algorithms and programming exercises. It will be constantly updated 
with solutions, tweaks and implementation that can be used as an excellent learning
resource. The tweaks and aolutions are not production quality software but simply a 
learning exercise.

Implementations are in Python or C++.

**Contents**
1. coding (programming exercises, math problems, etc.)
2. data_structures (data structures and algorithms)

** Future Algorithms : (in the works.. :-) , for implementation and practice).**
