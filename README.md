This repository contains implementation of well known data structures, algorithms
and many programming challenges. I will constantly keep updating this repository
with solutions and implementations that can be used as an excellent source of learning resource.
The solutions and exercises are not production quality software, but have been 
thoroughly thought through for scaling and production like environments.

Implementation in Python or C++.

**Contents**
1. algorithms (well known algorithms)
2. data-structures (data structures, math problems and programming exercises)
3. solutions (utilities, modules and solutions)
