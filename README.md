Data Structures, Algorithms and Coding Examples.

Copyright (C) 2018, Zubin Shah [zubin dot shah at gmail dot com]

This repository contains implementation of well known algorithms and several coding 
challenges. I will constantly keep on updating this repository with solutions, tweaks
and implementations that can be used as an excellent source of learning resource. 
The solutions and exercises are not production quality software.

Implementation in Python or C++.

**Contents**
1. coding (programming exercises, math problems, etc... )
2. data_structures (and algorithms)

** Future Algorithms : (in the works.. :-) , for implementation and practice).**
